      Hello, a bit about me.
My name is Muhammad Syamil Bin Annur Sani and I'm 20 years old.I'm a student from The National University Of Malaysia and enrolled in the course of Science Computer at Science and Information Technology Faculty (FTSM).Defination of me is I'm an enthusiastic, creative and friendly person
    </p>

     I love cars. That doesn't mean that I'm a good driver, that I could talk to you about the state of the automotive industry or that I could do anything to help you fix literally anything in any sort of meaningful fashion -- but I love the damn things nonetheless. This love actually extends beyond cars, to motorcycles, trucks, airplanes and basically any other marvel of engineering that, in a fair and just world, my incompetent fingers would never be allowed to touch. But as a dude who digs whirly things that go places, I find that most people either share that exact same love with me or else cannot understand the appeal in the slightest. So on behalf of all of us fans of controlled explosions with wheels on them, I figured I'd give a go at explaining this baffling affection, and maybe shed some light on what makes the box that occasionally takes you to the store something more special to us.
