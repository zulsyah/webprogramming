      Hi, my name is Zul. This is my page for my web programming course. I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard  to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-decription.I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about myself and your impression about me are not so diffrent. Here it goes</p>

    First of all, i'm from Kedah, but i born in Indonesia. My mother was from Indonesia but my father is Malaysian, so im typically a Malaysian.
